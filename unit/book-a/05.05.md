# Setting up VS Code with WSL

## Getting Started 

Before starting, make sure you have installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to your PC.

Visual Studio Code, along with the WSL extension, enables you to use WSL as your full-time development environment directly from VS Code.

## Installing the Remote Development Extension

Go to the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) page and press Install. It will prompt you to open Visual Studio Code.
